## Site Owner Goals
- Deliver an engaging quiz experience that combines fun and educational content about mushrooms, fostering curiosity and learning among users.

- Ensure the quiz interface is visually appealing and accessible and responsive across various devices.

- Instill a sense of urgency within users to complete the quiz quickly, motivating them to test their knowledge and improve their performance with each attempt.


## User Stories

### First Time User
- I want to test my knowledge about different mushroom species and their features.
- I hope to navigate the quiz effortlessly, understanding its features and presented information.
- I desire a dynamic and enjoyable experience, whether I'm tackling the quiz alone or sharing the excitement with friends.

## Design

### Imagery
- In this imaginative world, the background image boasts an antique white hue adorned with charming, cartoon-style illustrations of diverse mushroom varieties, creating a whimsical atmosphere.
- In the result box, a charming image featuring a large, cheerful mushroom accompanied by two smaller, equally adorable companions. Their lively antics and cute expressions bring an extra layer of delight to the experience.

### Colour scheme

I designed the colour palette for the website myself using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)

![Colour Palette]()

- The colour scheme for the Mushroom Quiz incorporates playful hues of green, red and antique white, inspired by the whimsical imagery of the mushroom world.
- These vibrant tones aim to create a cheerful and inviting atmosphere suitable for users of all ages.
- To ensure coherence and visual harmony, the color picker Chrome extension was utilized to extract the main colours from the background imagery, resulting in the creation of the curated colour palette displayed above.
- Accessibility considerations were paramount during the design process, with careful attention paid to establishing clear contrast between background colours and text elements. 

 ### Typography

 The site uses two primary fonts: "Actor" for body text and "Salsa" for headings and buttons.

I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to import the following:

- "Actor" offers a modern look, enhancing readability across devices.
- "Salsa" adds a touch of whimsy, aligning with the playful theme of the quiz.

Sans Serif is used as a backup font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

### Layout
The site is a single page with 4 sections:
  - Start area
  - Info Box
  - Quiz Box
  - Result Box


### Wireframes
I created these wireframes using Balsamiq.
